First of all this application is used to rent and rent the products you have or want to rent, then you can see who uploaded the product and if you click on their name you will see all the products that person has uploaded.
To rent the product must be available, meaning that no one has rented it yet, and then specify how many days you are going to rent it by using a calendar and the price will be multiplied by the number of days you rented it.
